Wow, we've covered a lot, well done us!

We started out looking at what Lithium is. We then defined a set of user stories that we wanted to implement. From there, we set up a workspace and did a bit of poking around.

Once we had a basic setup, we took a look at models, views and controllers, and how they fit together to build web applications in Lithium.

From there, we looked at testing, coding standards, and fixtures, and how to add validation to our models so that we can control what goes into them.

Already, we've built something that looks like a website and actually works! Hopefully you're starting to feel ready to build systems of your own!

Let's not get complacent, though... There's still plenty we haven't covered! First up - all apps need to do some form of logging...
