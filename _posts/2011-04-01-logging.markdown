It's extremely important to have logging in your application - things WILL go wrong, and the more insight you have into problems, the better.

Check out [Lithium's Logger.php](https://github.com/UnionOfRAD/lithium/blob/master/analysis/Logger.php) - this well-documented class is a good place to start to learn about logging in detail. We're going to add a few basic log messages to our app!

Good news, everybody! It's REALLY EASY to configure logging in Lithium!

OK first up we modify app/config/bootstrap.php and add an include:

{% highlight php %}
<?php
// ...

/**
 * This file contains configuration for logging
 */
require __DIR__ . '/bootstrap/logging.php';

// ...
{% endhighlight %}

Then, hit [http://staff-rolodex.localhost/staff](http://staff-rolodex.localhost/staff). You should see an error message:

<pre>
Warning: require(/var/www/staff-rolodex/app/config/bootstrap/logging.php): failed to open stream: No such file or directory in /var/www/staff-rolodex/app/config/bootstrap.php on line 62

Fatal error: require(): Failed opening required '/var/www/staff-rolodex/app/config/bootstrap/logging.php' (include_path='.:/usr/share/php:/usr/share/pear') in /var/www/staff-rolodex/app/config/bootstrap.php on line 62
</pre>

Now we create app/bootstrap/logging.php with these contents:

{% highlight php %}
<?php
use lithium\analysis\Logger;

Logger::config(array(
	'default' => array('adapter' => 'Syslog'),
	'problems' => array(
		'adapter' => 'File',
		'priority' => array('emergency', 'alert', 'critical', 'error')
	)
));
{% endhighlight %}

OK, now we're going to modify app/controllers/StaffController.php a bit:

{% highlight php %}
<?php
namespace app\controllers;

use app\models\Staff;
use lithium\action\DispatchException;
use lithium\analysis\Logger;

class StaffController extends \lithium\action\Controller {

	public function index() {
		$staffs = Staff::all();
		Logger::alert('Someone listed users...');
		return compact('staffs');
	}

    // ...
{% endhighlight %}

Now, hit the URL [http://staff-rolodex.localhost/staff](http://staff-rolodex.localhost/staff) to trigger a log write.

Finally, from the terminal, let's have a look at our log file:

<pre>
$ cat app/resources/tmp/logs/alert.log
2013-12-25 10:47:58 Someone listed users...
</pre>

_Yes, I am writing this on Christmas day!_

> *Did something go wrong?* Make sure app/resources/tmp/logs exists and is writeable by your web user.

Right, so what did we do here? Well, we defined two logging destinations - one to the system log, for all logging, and the other, 'problems', to a File. Lithium's File logger will log to app/resources/tmp/logs/{message type}.log. Because we used Logger::alert, it created alert.log. If we used "error", it would write to "error.log". Notice also this line:

<pre>
		'priority' => array('emergency', 'alert', 'critical', 'error')
</pre>

here, we can see that the file logger is only "paying attention" to 4 types of log events (called "message priority levels". The message priority levels which Logger supports are emergency, alert, critical, error, warning, notice, info and debug. By saying "Logger::alert('Someone listed users...');", we are using the "alert" level. We could equally to "Logger::critical" or "Logger::debug".

# Over to you!

That was pretty straightforward, right? At this point, I suggest adding logging to the methods of our controller. Don't worry, I'll wait while you do :-)
