# Building PHP Web Applications in Lithium

As is traditional, like my father before me, I issue the greeting of our people:

{% highlight php %}
<?php
echo "Hello world!";
?>
{% endhighlight %}

Right, so what are we going to learn here? Maybe nothing! Maybe you're super pro at Lithium already. That's cool, please let me know of any improvements that could be made to this book!

If you're new to Lithium, though, we're going to focus on building a web application with it. We're not going to delve far into the guys of Lithium, rather we're going to focus on how to actually use it to build a web application.

This book is meant to be a companion piece to the Lithium documentation at http://lithify.me/docs/manual/ so I'll be referring to that throughout.

We'll go through the steps of building an application from scratch. This application will be a "staff index", like a rolodex used to be in the 80s. Do you remember the 80s? I do. I never had a NES, Still hurts. I had a BBC Micro though, Elite was sweet.

Anyway, this application is a good choice (YES IT IS, HUSH YOU) because it will allow us to use:

* MVC architecture
* File uploads
* User access control
* Filters
* Logging
* Testing
* Performance analysis

Sounds pretty hashtag swag to me! Let's roll.
