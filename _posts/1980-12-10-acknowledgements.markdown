Thanks to [Dayle Rees](http://daylerees.com/) for the encouragement in my writing - he was instrumental helping me publish [Deal With It](https://leanpub.com/dealwithit/).

Big up [Warren, Carey, Craig, Jenko and Rod - team Unified Diff](http://unifieddiff.co.uk/)! Tech meetups are an important part of being a software developer and I'm glad we have this!

Thanks to my parents for their constant support and to my girl for somehow making me braver.

thanks to the #li3 room on Freenode, especially rapzo, wms and niftydigits, for helping test the book!

If you [bought this book](https://leanpub.com/step-by-step-lithium-php/), thanks to you! If you read it for free on line, that's cool as well, please consider dropping the price of a can of RedBull on buying a copy to help to support me to write more books!

Thanks for reading! I really hope you enjoyed the book and you now feel well equipped to get up and running with Li3. Of course, there's always plenty more to learn, but you can do it :-)

I'll leave you with one of my favourite quotes:

_"Courage is not simply one of the virtues but the form of every virtue at the testing point " - C.S. Lewis_
