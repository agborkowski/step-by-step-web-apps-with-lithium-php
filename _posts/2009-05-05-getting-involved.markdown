If I can be personal for one moment, I'd like to say that open source software has been a big part of my life. I've learned a lot from working with people in all sorts of projects, and being able to read code on Github and docs that people write has really helped me. That's why I've made these docs available for free on my Github, as well as for sale on Leanpub.

I'd recommend that all devs contribute to open source software. It helps you learn, to say nothing of the potential benefits for others!
