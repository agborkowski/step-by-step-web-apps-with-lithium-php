title:  Getting involved
---

If I can be personal for one moment, I'd like to say that open source software has been a big part of my life. I've learned a lot from working with people in all sorts of projects, and being able to read code on Github and docs that people write has really helped me. That's why I've made these docs available for free on my Github, as well as for sale on Leanpub.

I'd recommend that all devs contribute to open source software. It helps you learn, to say nothing of the potential benefits for others! In fact, I feel so strongly about it that I gave a talk at the 2013 Bristol IT MegaMeet on the topic "Coding in Community".

## Github

Github is a really good way of distributing open source software. It's so commonly used that you can really get involved. I'd recommend starting here first. Li3 has a whole bunch of repos, many of which are owned by the Union of Rad, who are the team behind Li3. Spend some time browsing [https://github.com/UnionOfRAD](https://github.com/UnionOfRAD) and you're sure to learn a thing or two!

## Reporting issues

The easiest way to get involved is to report any bugs that you find. Be a jolly good sausage and include a unit test if you can - this really helps the person to whom you are reporting the bug to know when it's resolved! Github is generally the place where most projects have their issue trackers.

## Documentation

The next level up, in my view, is creating docs. In fact, this book started because I wanted to learn Li3 and there wasn't a book that I could find, so it took it upon myself to write one!
