title:  Getting involved
---

If I can be personal for one moment, I'd like to say that open source software has been a big part of my life. I've learned a lot from working with people in all sorts of projects, and being able to read code on Github and docs that people write has really helped me. That's why I've made these docs available for free on my Github, as well as for sale on Leanpub.

I'd recommend that all devs contribute to open source software. It helps you learn, to say nothing of the potential benefits for others! In fact, I feel so strongly about it that I gave a talk at the 2013 Bristol IT MegaMeet on the topic "Coding in Community". It helps others who have helped you. Also, it raises your profile. I used to do a lot of interviewing in my last job and believe me, candidates with a lot of open source activity always appealed to me more than the Joey Jobsworths of this world!

## Github

Github is a really good way of distributing open source software. It's so commonly used that you can really get involved. I'd recommend starting here first. Li3 has a whole bunch of repos, many of which are owned by the Union of Rad, who are the team behind Li3. Spend some time browsing [https://github.com/UnionOfRAD](https://github.com/UnionOfRAD) and you're sure to learn a thing or two!

## Reporting issues

The easiest way to get involved is to report any bugs that you find. Be a jolly good sausage and include a unit test if you can - this really helps the person to whom you are reporting the bug to know when it's resolved! Github is generally the place where most projects have their issue trackers.

## Documentation

The next level up, in my view, is creating docs. In fact, this book started because I wanted to learn Li3 and there wasn't a book that I could find, so it took it upon myself to write one!

For example, I [contributed to documentation](https://github.com/michaelhue/li3_flash_message/pull/3) when writing this book - it can be really valuable. If you have a question, and you've done a bit of research, chance are others may have that question also.

## Fixing bugs

If you've reported an issue, perhaps you can fix it? Generally, my process is:

1. Fork the repository to my Github
1. Clone locally
1. Fix the bug
1. Push to my master (rebasing if there are upstream changes)
1. Submitting a **pull request**

All that Git gubbins is a bit out of scope of what this book is trying to get across but I want to encourage you - get involved with open source! You'll make mistakes - I've submitted dozens of pull requests where the devs have gone either "huh?" or "you've got the wrong end of the stick mate!" - doesn't matter! It's fun to be part of things.

## Creating plugins

You can extend Li3 with your own plugins - and then open source them back to the community! How cool is that!
