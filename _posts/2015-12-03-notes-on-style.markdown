I've included a lot of code snippets. Please note that where I put:

    // ...

that means I've snipped something out, or skipped over something - this means I don't have to include the whole entire file every time I want to just highlight a couple of lines! (Also, it means I can use the <?php opening tag, so I get all that syntax highlighting gubbins with no effort ;-))
